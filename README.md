A professional Android application designed for **70mai dashcam reverse engineering** and **automatic file synchronization**. It transfers videos and photos from 70mai dash cameras to a local folder on your device via a secure Wi-Fi handshake.

### Optimized for Search Engines (SEO Keywords)
`70mai dashcam backup`, `70mai protocol reverse engineering`, `70mai A500S video transfer`, `70mai A800S Android app`, `auto dashcam sync local folder`, `dashcam backup`, `70mai Wi-Fi protocol`, `com.lz1bgb.camhttp`.

## Key Features

- **Hybrid Networking**: Automatically binds HTTP requests to the dashcam's Wi-Fi network (192.168.0.1) even when mobile data is active. This allows the app to talk to the camera and maintain local network access simultaneously.
- **70mai Protocol Implementation**: Full implementation of the reverse-engineered 70mai handshake:
    1. `BindByBanya`: Initial pairing request.
    2. `UserconfirmByBanya`: Waiting for physical button press on the dashcam.
    3. `client.cgi`: Session registration and keep-alive.
- **Data Integrity**: 
    - Downloads files using a prioritized queue (oldest first).
    - Verifies file existence and size on the phone before sending the delete command to the camera.
    - Skips incomplete active recordings to ensure files are fully finalized by the camera.
- **Background Operation**: Runs as a foreground service with a persistent notification, ensuring Android doesn't kill the process during long transfers.
- **Statistics & Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of remaining files, download duration, speed, and transfer status.

## Installation & Download

The ready-to-install Android application can be found in the [apk/](apk/) directory of this project.

- **Latest APK**: [apk/camHttp-release-1.0.apk](apk/) (Note: Build the project to generate the latest file)
- **Minimum Requirements**: Android 10.0 (API level 29) or higher.

## Technical Implementation

### Networking
The app uses `OkHttpClient` with custom `SocketFactory` binding. When a target URL contains `192.168.0.1`, the app forces the traffic through the Wi-Fi interface, bypassing the system's default route (which usually prefers mobile data when Wi-Fi has no internet).

### File Management
1. **Camera Stage**: Scans all CGI types (0-15). Filters out files currently being recorded. Downloads via HTTP.
2. **Local Sync Stage**: Files are downloaded and saved to the configured local folder (or default app directory), preserving original directory structure (e.g., `/Normal/Front/`).
3. **Deletion**: Upon verified complete download, files are safely deleted from the camera storage to free up space.
